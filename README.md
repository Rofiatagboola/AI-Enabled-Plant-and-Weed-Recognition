# AI-Enabled-Plant-and-Weed-Recognition
<p>Currently, agricultural workers spend a significant amount of time manually inspecting and identifying different plants and weeds, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. 
	Despite advancements in agricultural technology, this manual labor requirement remains a bottleneck in the industry.
	By harnessing the power of AI, this project seeks to significantly reduce the time and effort needed to identify and sort plant seedlings. 
	AI and deep learning algorithms can be trained on vast amounts of data to recognize different plant species and distinguish them from weeds accurately.</p>
